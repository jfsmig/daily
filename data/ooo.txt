I've had a sleepless night
my <dog|cat> puked last night, it kept me up late. I'm <too tired|sleepless>.
I've been sprayed by a skunk, I cannot focus because of the smell
a tree fell on my car
my toe is trapped in the bath tap
my trousers split on the way to work
I've had a hair dye disaster
my curlers burned my hair, and I had to go to the hairdresser
I am stuck in my house because the door's broken
I forgot to come back to work after lunch
my brain went to sleep, and I couldn't wake it up
I forgot what day of the week it was
my dog has had a big fright and I don't want to leave him
I drank too much last night, and I don't know where I am
I woke up late and missed my train... again
I'm in A&E as I got a clothes peg stuck on my tongue
I ate some very spicy chicken wings last night -- It's best I stay home
I woke up and unexpectedly had to drive my family to another state
my bus broke down and was held up by robbers
I was arrested as a result of mistaken identity
I totaled my wife's jeep in a collision with a cow
a hitman was looking for me
I eloped. They are after, but won't catch me
I had to be there for my partner's grand jury trial
I had to ship my grandmother's bones to her homeland
someone slipped drugs in my drink last night
my car handbrake broke and it rolled down the hill into a lamppost
I'm using a new contact lens solution and my eyes are watering
I tripped over my dog and was knocked unconscious
I burned my hand on the toaster
I hurt myself bowling
I've got a sore finger
I have a blocked nose
I was spit on by a venomous snake. I admit, it hurts
my kids get sick only get sick on weekdays
a can of baked beans landed on my big toe
I've injured myself during sex
my new girlfriend bit me in a delicate place
I swallowed <white spirit|bioethanol>
I am <hallucinating|fainting>
I was swimming too fast and smacked my head on the poolside
I've been bitten by <an insect|a spider> and the larvaes start to get out
someone slipped drugs in my drink last night
